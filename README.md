# Office of Food Justice Chatbot v2
Development of the next version of a chatbot for the Office of Food Access

## Getting started with a chatbot
1. The best place to start is almost always pen and paper. Make a simple diagram of how you expect your users to navigate the options.
1. Another way to start, or once you have an initial diagram go ahead and use a digital tool to make it easier to edit and move things around. We used Lucidchart, but you could also use Figma, Visio, Google Slides, whatever works for you. A good starting point is a flowchart.
